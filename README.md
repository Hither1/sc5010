# Google Stock Price Analysis

In our modern world, Tech Companies have rapidly grown from niche markets to providing services used by almost everyone. However, as the sector has rapidly expanded, multiple tech companies have established themselves and compete with each other. This brings up the question: How does Google, one of the largest and well known company in the sector, affected by its competitors.

In this project, we hope to compare the effectiveness of using other stocks to predict the price and using time series models. In this way, we can understand deeper about the differences of machine learning models and statistical models. 


The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges to the Healthcare companies, for example, shifting consumer demands towards fast and convenient services. As a result, they are forced to take on digital transformations. On the other hand, big tech companies are also looking to occupy the niche markets in the Healthcare industry. Therefore, many companies in those two sectors formed partnetships.

## Problem Definition
- Are we able to predict the closing price of Google stocks using the stocks of other Information-Technology companies
- Out of all the models we used, which one "best" predicts the Google price.
