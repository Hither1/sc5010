The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges to the Healthcare companies, for example, shifting consumer demands towards fast and convenient services. As a result, they are forced to take on digital transformations. On the other hand, big tech companies are also looking to occupy the niche markets in the Healthcare industry. Therefore, many companies in those two sectors formed partnetships. 

In this project, we hope to study the relationship between the two sectors by investigating their stock prices.
