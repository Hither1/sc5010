# Google Stock Price Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges to the Healthcare companies, for example, shifting consumer demands towards fast and convenient services. As a result, they are forced to take on digital transformations. On the other hand, big tech companies are also looking to occupy the niche markets in the Healthcare industry. Therefore, many companies in those two sectors formed partnetships. 

In this project, we hope to compare the effectiveness of using other stocks to predict the price and uaing time series models. In this way, we can understand deeper about the differences of machine learning models and statistical models.
